# overview
fundy allows users to compute technical analysis indicators on time series data through a simple API. fundy can also be used to create combination indicators, allowing for the creation of fundamental analysis strategies natively. Strategies can be ran on a basket of stocks and trades can be sent automatically via the Alpaca API

# Usage
Note that use of this library requires the alpaca api. An account may be set up at https://alpaca.markets/. Once you set an account up, you can generate a secret key and an ID key. Paste this information in the fundy/api_config.py, and you're good to go.
